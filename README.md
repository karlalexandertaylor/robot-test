# robot-test

The purpose of this application is to build a small robot application which calculates the distance from the start point and whether the robot has moved in a circle.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

The application are written in python.

They were executed and tested against python 3.8.

This application is two code files:

    - oprog1.py
    - oprog2.py
    
There are a number of test files to use with the programs and these exist in the tests directory

The structure to run the run the program is:

    python oprog1.py ./tests/test1.dir

or

    python oprog2.py ./tests/test1.dir

if you want to run the program in debug mode use this run command:

    python oprog1.py ./tests/test1.dir 1

or
